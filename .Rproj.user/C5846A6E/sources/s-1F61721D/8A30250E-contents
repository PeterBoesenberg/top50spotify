# Top 50 Spotify Songs
This project demonstrates how easy it is to cluster data with R and visualize it. I got the data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top50spotify2019)

I built clusters with K-Means and visualized it with Plotly. Afterwards I was curious and checked, if there is a correlation between the genre of the songs and the new clusters. Neither an ANOVA nor a multiple regression showed promising results.
